# Binaries are built into dist by pkg, but for npm package we might want just the CLI entry point
# "main" in package.json points to "bin/ghx.js", so we need that.
# If compiling to binary for npm is not the goal (usually npm install installs the JS package + bin link), 
# then we don't strictly need to ignore everything, but let's keep it clean.
# Ensure 'bin' folder is NOT ignored.
